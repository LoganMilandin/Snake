# Snake

This is an implementation of the classic Snake game in Python. I wrote it to familiarize myself with Python's object-oriented features

## Usage

1. Download the repository, nagivate to it
2. Install tkinter if your version of Python doesn't come with it
4. ```bash
   python snake_main.py
   ```
5. To let the bot play instead, change using_bot in snake_main from False to True

## Features

The player uses arrow keys to control the snake and eat apples

There is also a rudimentary bot that can be enabled, which will always fill up the board completely if it's an even size, albeit slowly (note that it's impossible to fill an odd-size board; see traveling salesman problem)

The user can easily adjust the board size
